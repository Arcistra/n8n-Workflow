# 📩 Email Summarizer Workflow (n8n + OpenAI + Google Sheets)
This repository contains an n8n automation workflow that automatically:
- Fetches the latest Gmail messages (every minute).
- Summarizes the email content using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini.
- Appends the summarized email details (ID, Subject, From, Date, Summary) into a Google Sheet for easy tracking and review.
It’s a simple yet powerful example of combining email automation, AI summarization, and structured data storage.
